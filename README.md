## Description

I didn't have experience with React.js before and in 2 days I was able to learn as much as I can and build a pretty ugly slider. It is compatible with mobile and desktop devices, however, I couldn't implement swipe functions and animations without using non-core react libraries, but it supports infinite looping through elements.

## Installation

```
Clone repo in designated folder.
cd *path to your folder*
npm install
